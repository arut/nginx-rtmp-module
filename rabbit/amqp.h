Remarks:

 A1, A2: Notice how the types **CONFLICT** here. In Qpid and Rabbit,
         's' means a signed 16-bit integer; in 0-9-1, it means a
          short string.

 B: Notice how the signednesses **CONFLICT** here. In Qpid and Rabbit,
    'l' means a signed 64-bit integer; in 0-9-1, it means an unsigned
    64-bit integer.

I'm going with the Qpid/Rabbit types, where there's a conflict, and
the 0-9-1 types otherwise. 0-8 is a subset of 0-9, which is a subset
of the other two, so this will work for both 0-8 and 0-9-1 branches of
the code.
