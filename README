NGINX-based RTMP server

Wiki manual:

  https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module/wiki


Features:

* Live streaming of video/audio

* Stream relay support for distributed
  streaming: push & pull models

* Recording published streams in FLV file

* H264 support

* Online transcoding with FFmpeg 
  (experimental; Linux only)

* HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) support
  (experimental; H264/AAC/MP3)

* HTTP callbacks on publish/play/record

* Advanced buffering techniques
  to keep memory allocations at a minimum
  level for faster streaming and low
  memory footprint

* Works with Flash RTMP clients as well as
  ffmpeg/rtmpdump/flvstreamer etc
  (see examples in test/ subdir)

* Statistics in XML/XSL in machine- & human-
  readable form


Build:

cd to NGINX source directory & run this:

./configure --add-module=<path-to-nginx-rtmp-module>
make
make install


Note the module does not share data between workers
and only works in one-worker mode. 


RTMP URL format:

rtmp://rtmp.example.com/<app>[/<name>]

<app> -  should match one of application {}
         blocks in config
<name> - interpreted by each application
         can be empty


Example nginx.conf:

rtmp {

    server {

        listen 1935;

        chunk_size 4000;

        # TV mode: one publisher, many subscribers
        application mytv {

            # enable live streaming
            live on;

            # record first 1K of stream
            record all;
            record_path /tmp/av;
            record_max_size 1K;

            # append current timestamp to each flv
            record_unique on;

            # publish only from localhost
            allow publish 127.0.0.1;
            deny publish all;

            #allow play all;
        }

        # Transcoding (ffmpeg needed)
        application big {
            live on;

            # On every pusblished stream run this command (ffmpeg)
            # with substitutions: $app/${app}, $name/${name} for application & stream name.
            #
            # This ffmpeg call receives stream from this application &
            # reduces the resolution down to 32x32. The stream is the published to
            # 'small' application (see below) under the same name.
            #
            # ffmpeg can do anything with the stream like video/audio
            # transcoding, resizing, altering container/codec params etc
            #
            # Multiple exec lines can be specified.

            exec /usr/bin/ffmpeg -re -i rtmp://localhost:1935/$app/$name -vcodec flv -acodec copy -s 32x32 -f flv rtmp://localhost:1935/small/${name};
        }

        application small {
            live on;
            # Video with reduced resolution comes here from ffmpeg
        }

        application mypush {
            live on;

            # Every stream published here
            # is automatically pushed to 
            # these two machines
            push rtmp1.example.com;
            push rtmp2.example.com:1934;
        }

        application mypull {
            live on;

            # Pull all streams from remote machine
            # and play locally
            pull rtmp3.example.com;
        }

        # Many publishers, many subscribers
        # no checks, no recording
        application videochat {

            live on;

            # The following notifications receive all 
            # the session variables as well as 
            # particular call arguments in HTTP POST
            # request

            # Make HTTP request & use HTTP retcode
            # to decide whether to allow publishing
            # from this connection or not
            on_publish http://localhost:8080/publish;

            # Same with playing
            on_play http://localhost:8080/play;

            # Publish/play end (repeats on disconnect)
            on_done http://localhost:8080/done;

            # All above mentioned notifications receive
            # standard connect() arguments as well as 
            # play/publish ones. If any arguments are sent
            # with GET-style syntax to play & publish
            # these are also included.
            # Example URL:
            #   rtmp://localhost/myapp/mystream?a=b&c=d

            # record 10 video keyframes (no audio) every 2 minutes
            record keyframes;
            record_path /tmp/vc;
            record_max_frames 10;
            record_interval 2m;

            # Async notify about an flv recorded
            on_record_done http://localhost:8080/record_done;

        }


        # HLS (experimental)

        # HLS requires libavformat & should be configured as a separate
        # NGINX module in addition to nginx-rtmp-module:
        # ./configure ... --add-module=/path/to/nginx-rtmp-module/hls ...

        # For HLS to work please create a directory in tmpfs (/tmp/app here)
        # for the fragments. The directory contents is served via HTTP (see
        # http{} section in config)
        #
        # Incoming stream must be in H264/AAC/MP3. For iPhones use baseline H264
        # profile (see ffmpeg example).
        # This example creates RTMP stream from movie ready for HLS:
        #
        # ffmpeg -loglevel verbose -re -i movie.avi  -vcodec libx264 
        #    -vprofile baseline -acodec libmp3lame -ar 44100 -ac 1 
        #    -f flv rtmp://localhost:1935/hls/movie
        #
        # If you need to transcode live stream use 'exec' feature.
        #
        application hls {
            hls on;
            hls_path /tmp/app;
            hls_fragment 5s;
        }

    }
}

# HTTP can be used for accessing RTMP stats
http {

    server {

        listen      8080;

        # This URL provides RTMP statistics in XML
        location /stat {
            rtmp_stat all;

            # Use this stylesheet to view XML as web page
            # in browser
            rtmp_stat_stylesheet stat.xsl;
        }

        location /stat.xsl {
            # XML stylesheet to view RTMP stats.
            # Copy stat.xsl wherever you want
            # and put the full directory path here
            root /path/to/stat.xsl/;
        }

        location /hls {
            # Serve HLS fragments
            alias /tmp/app;
        }

    }
}
