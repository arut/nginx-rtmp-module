### Features

* RTMP/HLS/MPEG-DASH live streaming

* RTMP Video on demand FLV/MP4,
  playing from local filesystem or HTTP

* Stream relay support for distributed
  streaming: push & pull models

* Recording streams in multiple FLVs

* H264/AAC support

* Online transcoding with FFmpeg

* HTTP callbacks (publish/play/record/update etc)

* Running external programs on certain events (exec)

* HTTP control module for recording audio/video and dropping clients

* Advanced buffering techniques
  to keep memory allocations at a minimum
  level for faster streaming and low
  memory footprint

* Proved to work with Wirecast, FMS, Wowza,
  JWPlayer, FlowPlayer, StrobeMediaPlayback,
  ffmpeg, avconv, rtmpdump, flvstreamer
  and many more

* Statistics in XML/XSL in machine- & human-
  readable form

* Linux/FreeBSD/MacOS/Windows

### Build

cd to NGINX source directory & run this:

    ./configure --add-module=/path/to/nginx-rtmp-module
    make
    make install

Several versions of nginx (1.3.14 - 1.5.0) require http_ssl_module to be
added as well:

    ./configure --add-module=/path/to/nginx-rtmp-module --with-http_ssl_module

For building debug version of nginx add `--with-debug`

    ./configure --add-module=/path/to-nginx/rtmp-module --with-debug

[Read more about debug log](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module/wiki/Debug-log)

### Windows limitations

Windows support is limited. These features are not supported

* execs
* static pulls
* auto_push

### RTMP URL format

    rtmp://rtmp.example.com/app[/name]

app -  should match one of application {}
         blocks in config

name - interpreted by each application
         can be empty


### Multi-worker live streaming

Module supports multi-worker live
streaming through automatic stream pushing
to nginx workers. This option is toggled with
rtmp_auto_push directive.


### Example nginx.conf

    rtmp {

        server {

            listen 1935;

            chunk_size 4000;

            # TV mode: one publisher, many subscribers
            application mytv {

                # enable live streaming
                live on;

                # record first 1K of stream
                record all;
                record_path /tmp/av;
                record_max_size 1K;

                # append current timestamp to each flv
                record_unique on;

                # publish only from localhost
                allow publish 127.0.0.1;
                deny publish all;

                #allow play all;
            }

            # Transcoding (ffmpeg needed)
            application big {
                live on;

                # On every published stream run this command (ffmpeg)
                # with substitutions: $app/${app}, $name/${name} for application & stream name.
                #
                # This ffmpeg call receives stream from this application &
                # reduces the resolution down to 32x32. The stream is the published to
                # 'small' application (see below) under the same name.
                #
                # ffmpeg can do anything with the stream like video/audio
                # transcoding, resizing, altering container/codec params etc
                #
                # Multiple exec lines can be specified.

            }

            application small {

                push rtmp1.example.com;
                push rtmp2.example.com:1934;

            # HLS

            # For HLS to work please create a directory in tmpfs (/tmp/hls here)
            # for the fragments. The directory contents is served via HTTP (see
            # http{} section in config)
            #
            # Incoming stream must be in H264/AAC. For iPhones use baseline H264
            # profile (see ffmpeg example).
            # This example creates RTMP stream from movie ready for HLS:
            #
            # ffmpeg -loglevel verbose -re -i movie.avi  -vcodec libx264
            #    -vprofile baseline -acodec libmp3lame -ar 44100 -ac 1
            #    -f flv rtmp://localhost:1935/hls/movie
            #
            # If you need to transcode live stream use 'exec' feature.

### Multi-worker streaming example

    rtmp_auto_push on;

    rtmp {
        server {
            listen 1935;

            application mytv {
                live on;
            }
        }
